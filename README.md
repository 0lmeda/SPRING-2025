## CSCI1101 project
### Jose Olmeda
### Description
This is my project for the class, it is a basic website made from scratch, it is about AI
and their uses in the school.
the main page is the index.html, it has its own .css in the same html file, however the other pages uses the same style, so I made a .css file to reuse that code
also this website it is in spanish and english, the webpage it is responsive in smartphones too, actually, it looks better in mobile devices.

## Facts
1. The website is live on my domain joseolmeda.com
2. The htcdocs was used for my website, because in mobiles devices when someone enter to my website, it was sending them to http instead of https
3. I used this website as project for two classes
4. I don't like websites and program them
